Tired of the repetitive `git` commands just to get your project on GitHub? Wish you could update a single file without a full `clone`, `commit`, and `push` cycle? **`PyGitUp` is the solution.**

This tool streamlines your entire GitHub workflow, whether you're pushing a brand-new project or updating a single file in an existing repository.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   ‚úÖ **Dual-Mode Operation:**
    -   **Project Mode:** Upload an entire project directory. `PyGitUp` initializes a git repo, creates the remote on GitHub, and pushes your code in one go.
    -   **File Mode:** Upload or overwrite a single file directly using the GitHub API. Perfect for quick updates.
-   ‚úÖ **Interactive & Smart:**
    -   A clean, interactive menu to choose your workflow.
    -   A file selector that lists files in your current directory for easy selection.
    -   Remembers your credentials for the session and can use environment variables for convenience.
-   ‚úÖ **User-Friendly:**
    -   Securely prompts for your GitHub Personal Access Token.
    -   Handles existing repositories and non-empty remotes gracefully with a force-push option.
    -   Clear, step-by-step prompts guide you through the process.
