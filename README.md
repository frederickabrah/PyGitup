Tired of the repetitive `git` commands just to get your project on GitHub? Wish you could update a single file without a full `clone`, `commit`, and `push` cycle? **`PyGitUp` is the solution.**

This tool streamlines your entire GitHub workflow, whether you're pushing a brand-new project or updating a single file in an existing repository.

## ‚ú® Key Features

    -   **Project Mode:** Upload an entire project directory. `PyGitUp` initializes a git repo, creates the remote on GitHub, and pushes your code in one go.

    -   **Batch Mode:** Upload multiple files at once with a single command.
-   ‚úÖ **Flexible Configuration:**
    -   Command-line arguments for automated usage
    -   Configuration file support (`pygitup.yaml`) for default settings
    -   Environment variable support for credentials
-   ‚úÖ **Enhanced User Experience:**
    -   A clean, interactive menu to choose your workflow.
    -   A file selector that lists files in your current directory for easy selection.
    -   Progress bars for long operations
    -   Detailed logging capabilities
-   ‚úÖ **User-Friendly:**
    -   Securely prompts for your GitHub Personal Access Token.
    -   Handles existing repositories and non-empty remotes gracefully with a force-push option.
    -   Clear, step-by-step prompts guide you through the process.
