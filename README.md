## Core Capabilities

PyGitUp provides a robust suite of automation and intelligence tools:

*   **Repository Automation:** Streamlines initialization, remote synchronization, and deployment into single-command workflows.
*   **AI Assistant (Autonomous):** A full-stack AI engineer capable of reading code, writing fixes, and executing system tasks natively.
*   **AI Diagnostic Loop:** A functional self-healing system that executes commands (like tests), analyzes failures, and proposes direct code repairs.
*   **Security Sentinel:** AST-based static analysis (SAST) to detect command injections, hardcoded secrets, and sensitive file exposures.
*   **Predictive Analytics:** Data-driven growth forecasting based on engagement velocity, fork density, and maintenance health.
*   **Digital Footprint (OSINT):** Deep repository reconnaissance, extracting social metadata, digital footprints, and hidden community metrics.
*   **Smart Push & Release:** AI-powered conventional commit generation and professional release management with automated changelogs.

## 📺 Immersive TUI Dashboard

PyGitUp features a comprehensive **Text User Interface (TUI)** for developers who prefer a graphical terminal experience (Option 34).

*   **Engineering Hub:** Manage project context, active profiles, and autonomous AI tasks.
*   **Intelligence Center:** Real-time data visualization for repository stats and trends.
*   **Native Operations:** Manage Pull Requests, Gists, and SSH keys through dedicated, immersive views.

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/frederickabrah/PyGitUp.git

## Transparency & Security

*   **Security First:** PyGitUp enforces encrypted credential storage using the `cryptography` library. It refuses to store tokens in insecure formats.
*   **Safe Execution:** All system calls are audited to prevent command injection. Path validation is enforced to block traversal attempts.
*   **Community Integration:** To support the project's growth, PyGitUp includes a community integration feature that ensures users follow the project development and star the repository upon initial use.
*   **Local Privacy:** All GitHub tokens and AI keys are stored locally on your machine. No telemetry or sensitive data is ever transmitted to external servers except for direct GitHub API interactions.
