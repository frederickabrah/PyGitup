‎Act as a senior security researcher and code archaeologist. Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis of this codebase using all available AI agents to identify:
‎1. SECURITY VULNERABILITIES:
‎- Path traversal vulnerabilities
‎- Command injection possibilities
‎- Remote code execution vectors
‎- Insecure deserialization
‎- Cross-site scripting risks
‎- Authentication/authorization bypasses
‎- SQL injection or similar injection flaws
‎- File inclusion vulnerabilities
‎- Race conditions
‎- Privilege escalation possibilities
‎2. IMPLEMENTATION GAPS & FAKE CODE:
‎- Placeholder functions that return hardcoded values
‎- Empty implementations marked with TODO/FIXME
‎- Functions that return null/undefined instead of real values
‎- Fake algorithms that look sophisticated but don't work
‎- Incomplete feature implementations
‎- Mock data instead of real processing
‎- "Vibe coded" sections that look impressive but lack substance
‎- Inconsistent API implementations
‎- Unimplemented features mentioned in docs but not in code
‎3. ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES:
‎- Poor separation of concerns
‎- Tight coupling where loose coupling is needed
‎- Missing error handling
‎- Inadequate input validation
‎- Poor resource management
‎- Scalability limitations
‎- Performance bottlenecks
‎4. DEPLOYMENT READINESS:
‎- Missing tests
‎- Inadequate documentation
‎- Hardcoded credentials or secrets
‎- Debugging code in production paths
‎- Missing license information
‎- Incomplete CI/CD setup
‎- Privacy concerns
‎Use all available agents (Security-Auditor, Code-Review-Master, code-executioner, Bug-Smasher, Prod-Ready-Finalizer, Test-Genius, etc.) to perform deep analysis. Examine every aspect of the codebase including:
‎- All source files
‎- Configuration files
‎- Dependencies
‎- Documentation
‎- Test files (if any)
‎- Build scripts
‎- Deployment configurations
‎Provide a comprehensive report with:
‎- Executive summary of critical issues
‎- Detailed technical descriptions
‎- Risk levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
‎- Exploitation scenarios
‎- Specific file locations and line numbers
‎- Recommended fixes
‎- Priority order for addressing issues
‎- Assessment of whether the project is ready for public release
‎Focus especially on identifying "vibe coded" implementations that look sophisticated but don't actually function as advertised. Look for signs of rushed development, placeholder logic, and features that exist only in documentation but not in actual code.Act as a senior security researcher, red-team engineer, code archaeologist, and production readiness auditor. Perform an exhaustive forensic and adversarial analysis of this entire codebase as if it were about to be deployed to millions of users and actively targeted by skilled attackers.

Assume:
- The code may be maliciously or incompetently written
- Documentation may lie or exaggerate
- Some implementations may exist purely for appearance ("vibe coded")
- Attackers have partial access and strong motivation

Use all available AI agents (Security-Auditor, Red-Team-Operator, Code-Review-Master, Static-Analyzer, Runtime-Executioner, Bug-Smasher, Architecture-Critic, Test-Genius, and Prod-Ready-Finalizer) and cross-validate findings between them.

──────────────── SECURITY ANALYSIS ────────────────
Identify and explain all potential vulnerabilities including but not limited to:
- Path traversal and arbitrary file access
- Command injection and shell escape vectors
- Remote code execution (direct and chained)
- Insecure deserialization and object injection
- Cross-site scripting (stored, reflected, DOM-based)
- Authentication and authorization bypasses
- Session fixation, token leakage, and weak crypto usage
- SQL injection, NoSQL injection, template injection, and logic-level injections
- File inclusion and unsafe dynamic imports
- Race conditions and TOCTOU vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation paths (horizontal and vertical)
- Dependency-based and supply-chain vulnerabilities

For each issue, describe:
- Root cause
- Exploitation prerequisites
- Realistic attack scenarios
- Impact severity

──────────────── IMPLEMENTATION TRUTH CHECK ────────────────
Aggressively hunt for fake, misleading, or incomplete implementations:
- Placeholder logic, stubs, and hardcoded returns
- TODO/FIXME sections that hide missing functionality
- Functions returning null/None/undefined instead of real results
- Algorithms that appear complex but do not actually work
- Dead code and unreachable execution paths
- Mock data used where real processing is claimed
- Features claimed in README/docs but absent or nonfunctional in code
- Inconsistent or partially implemented APIs
- “Vibe coded” sections optimized for aesthetics over correctness

Explicitly call out:
- What the code *pretends* to do vs what it *actually* does
- Any misleading naming, comments, or structure

──────────────── ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN AUTOPSY ────────────────
Evaluate the system architecture for:
- Violations of separation of concerns
- Excessive coupling and hidden dependencies
- Global state abuse
- Poor error handling and silent failures
- Inadequate input validation and trust boundaries
- Resource leaks (memory, file handles, processes)
- Scalability and concurrency limitations
- Performance bottlenecks and algorithmic inefficiencies

Explain how these flaws will fail in:
- Real production traffic
- Adversarial conditions
- Long-term maintenance

──────────────── DEPLOYMENT & PRODUCTION READINESS ────────────────
Assess whether this project is safe to ship:
- Test coverage gaps and untested critical paths
- Debug or dev-only code reachable in production
- Hardcoded secrets, keys, tokens, or credentials
- Missing or weak logging, monitoring, and alerting
- Incomplete CI/CD pipelines and unsafe build steps
- Missing licensing, legal, or compliance requirements
- Privacy and data-handling risks

──────────────── REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ────────────────
Produce a professional-grade audit report containing:
- Executive summary of critical and systemic risks
- Detailed technical findings with file paths and line numbers
- Risk classification (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- Exploitation narratives where applicable
- Concrete, actionable remediation steps
- Priority-ordered fix roadmap
- Final verdict: Is this project fit for public release? Why or why not?

Do NOT be polite.
Do NOT assume good intent.
Do NOT give the benefit of the doubt.

Treat this codebase as guilty until proven innocent.
